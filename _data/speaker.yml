  title: "Particle physics with accelerators: the energy and intensity/precision frontiers; two examples from the activities @ Roma Tre."
  bio: "Dr. Petrucci is working in Roma Tre University since the year 2003, after getting his PhD, with different position at University or INFN, then as a researcher (since 2008) and finally as a professor (since 2016). 
He has been local coordinator and member of the National Scientific Committee 1 (Particle physics) of INFN and referee for INFN of some experimental activities.
For the department of Mathematics and Physics, he is currently member of the Physics PhD board and deputy for the Infrastructures within the “Excellence Department” project (Dipartimento di Eccellenza).
He has always been involved in the study of proton-proton high energy collisions at LHC. In particular, with the ATLAS experiment, he focused on inclusive leptons cross sections measurements and Higgs boson searches and measurements. He built, tested and installed some of the ATLAS muon detectors and he was responsible for the calibrations of the muon detectors in the period 2010-2012. In the last years he's been involved in R&D and construction for the phase-1 upgrades of the ATLAS muon detectors and in the R&D of innovative Micro Patters Gas Detector for tracking under high rates. Recently, his interests are moving to different topics as neutrino physics (with the JUNO experiment) and to the search of Dark Matter exploiting the so called “directionality” (within the CYGNO project)."

  title: "Research Activities in the field of Astroparticle Physics @ Roma Tre"
  bio: "Prof. Bussino graduated in Physics at the Pisa University in November 1980. He got a Postgraduate Degree in Nuclear and Particle
Physics in 1984, followed by a PhD in Physics at the Rome University La Sapienza in September 1992. Starting from 2022, he is a Physics Researcher at the Roma Tre University, carrying out experimental scientific
activity in the field of Astroparticle Physics, with a special interest for Data Analysis, Monte Carlo simulations and Software Development. Past research activity in the field of Cosmic Rays Physics
(Collaborations MACRO and ARGO-YBJ). At the moment he is part of the Collaborations DarkSide and Belle II, with a focus on the search for Dark Matter."

  title: "The birth of the Universe and Particle Physics" 
  bio: "Prof. Anna Di Ciaccio is full professor at the University of Roma Tor Vergata. She has been involved in research in experimental particle physics since 1980. 
  From 1981 till 1983 she was research associate at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, USA. She worked at the Physics Department of the Harvard University in Cambridge and later in
  the Oak-Ridge American Laboratory to set up a Montecarlo program to simulate the hadron particle interactions. She was fellow at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, participating in several experiments on accelerators to study proton-proton and protonantiproton
 collision, and pion-nucleon interactions. Since 1992 she is a member of the ATLAS international Collaboration and is the group leader of the research group at the University of Roma Tor Vergata. In the last two years she has contributed to the R&D work
for the superB experiment. She is currently teaching to undergraduate and graduate student courses related to the Experimental Technique in Nuclear and Subnuclear Physics and Advanced Particle Physics."

  title: "Baryons spectrum and structure"
  bio: "Prof. Annalisa D’Angelo got a Master Degree in Physics at University Rooma La Sapienza, and since 2001 is Associate Professor of Nuclear and Sub-nuclear Physics at University of Roma Tor Vergata. 
  She has devoted her research activity to the study of photo-nuclear reactions with polarized Compton backscattered photon beams at the LADON (Frascati) , LEGS (Brookhaven, USA)
and GRAAL (Grenoble) facilities, with the aim of investigating the nucleon baryonic resonances, also using frozen spin polarized HD targets. Since 2009 she has continued the same activity as a
member of the CLAS Collaboration (JLAB, USA), where the use of a polarized electron beam extended the research to the study of the internal structure of the nucleon through electron
scattering reactions and nucleon-nucleon correlation in nuclei. Since 2013 she is part of the HPS collaboration dedicated to the search of light dark matter at
JLAB. In 2016 she also joined the EIC user group."

  title: "The Cosmic Background Radiation from Planck to LiteBIRD"
  bio: "Prof. Vittorio Nicola is full professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Roma Tor Vergata. He is president of the Coordination
Structure of Research Doctorates of Tor Vergata and vice-Coordinator of the Research Doctorates Class of Astronomy, Astrophysics and Space
Science. His research interests are correlated to a theoretical activity in cosmology and in galaxy formation. He was Co-I of the ESA/Planck mission, finding
definitive results on anisotropies of Cosmic Microwave Background temperature. He is cooperating for the realization of the JAXA/LiteBIRD satellite and he is the Scientific Manager of the ASI/
COSMOS Agreement for the national coordination of Cosmology activities. He is author of more than 200 articles on international magazines, with more than 25.000 quotes. He is a National Partner
of the Scienze Academy in Torino, Worthy Partner of the Italian Physics Society (SIF) and he is a member of the European Physics Society (EPS), International Astronomical Union and European
Academy of Sciences and Arts."

  title: "Astroparticle Physics at the University of Rome Tor Vergata"
  bio: "Prof. Roberta Sparvoli is associate professor of Nuclear and Subnuclear Physics at the University of Roma Tor Vergata and she has a research
assignment at Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (National Institute of Nuclear Physics). She focused her scientific activity on researching
Antimatter and Dark Matter signals, and on studying nuclear and isotopic components of Cosmic Rays at high energy. She carried out interdisciplinary research activities
conducted in space aboard the two Space Stations MIR and ISS. She participated in space missions like NINA and PAMELA. She currently coordinates a group of about 20 people in the Physics
Department of Tor Vergata, whose most important mission is the CES/Limadou Italian-Chinese experiment, which is studying electromagnetic perturbations and ionosphere particles."
